# Replay Workbench, a plugin for OBS Studio

## Introduction

This work-in-progress plugin aims to provide professional-grade instant-replay functionality in OBS for use in live e-sports and other events. A list of features anticipated for the plugin is below:

Essential functionality:
 - OBS Filter to select 'clippable' sources
 - Multiple clip slots
 - Live feed and clip buffer preview window
 - Live clip mark and scrub capability
 - JPEG/CPU based frame encoding to increase clippable time.

Potential future capabilities:
 - Hardware encoding support (Built on OBS' existing encoding support)
 - Custom hardware replay operator's console
 - Networked clipping (Separate replay operators' PC)


## Build Instructions

This project is not yet ready for release, and is intended to release at SouthLANder 2024, a UK LAN e-sports event. As such, I will not be releasing pre-built binaries until after this date. If you would like to build the plugin yourself, it follows a similar process to other plugins built on the OBS plugin template (https://github.com/obsproject/obs-plugintemplate)
